# Nummy Word

A technical test for a company in London.

## Requirements

Write a Ruby script which translate numbers into English words. It should work like this:

=> one

$ ruby num2english.rb 11
=> eleven

$ ruby num2english.rb 1001
=> one thousand one
```

Please implement it step by step using RSpec, in multiple git commits as you'd normally do in any project, following TDD. Also, don't hesitate to use OOP.

More details:
  * Only positive numbers

  * Only integers
